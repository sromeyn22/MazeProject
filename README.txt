In the first screen that appears, the user is able to choose the options for the maze such as the dimensions of the maze, the type of maze (2D/3D), or a key to generate a specific maze (each key maps to one randomly generate maze)
In the 2D maze, the user can move around with the arrow keys and in the 3D maze, the user can move around with the arrow keys and turn with 'a' or 'd'. The goal is to get from the top left square in the maze to the bottom right square. The length of the maze is displayed in red in the top right corner. In the 3D maze, the user will also encounter enemies (red blobs) they can fight by pressing the space bar.
